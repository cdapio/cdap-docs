The CDAP is a data application platform for building and managing data analytics applications in hybrid and multi-cloud environments. It enables developers with data and application abstractions to accelerate development of analytics applications, addressing a broader range of real-time and batch use cases.
CDAP in addition to providing the ability to develop and manage applications, it also supports these essential capabilities:

* Java-based developer APIs and runtime for managing application;
* Portability of applications through decoupling underlying infrastructures;
* Abstraction of data through logical representations of underlying data;
* Services and tools that enable faster application creation in development;
* Higher degrees of operational control in production through enterprise best practices.
