CDAP started as an open source project in 2011. CDAP was developed by Cask Data Inc. that was acquired by Google in 2018. CDAP has been in development for more than 8+ years and is running in production in multiple enterprises for about 5+ years. CDAP post-acquisition has had continued support at Google and its support and commitment to keep it open source.

Cloud Data Fusion (CDF) is a fully-managed offering of CDAP on GCP stack. There is no separate branch of CDAP for CDF that is maintained. Cloud Data Fusion is generally behind a release of CDAP open source, to ensure an extensive testing cycle for integration within Google infrastructure. Bugs and Features that are deemed relevant and appropriate are eventually applied to open source. All security bugs related to CDAP immediately get applied to CDAP in open source.
