      <description>Our goal was to create a simple, effective and multilingual blog on 3D technology that could be managed by a non-technical profile.
Why Hugo? Hugo addresses all these needs, coupled with Forestry.io for its administration via a &amp;ldquo;turnkey&amp;rdquo; interface. We have attached particular importance to SEO, and therefore to the creation of an advanced taxonomy system. Thus, each author and tag has a dedicated page, listing the related posts.
What we liked  The multilingual content support, especially simpel to setup.</description>

      <description>We wanted to shake the status quo with PHARMASEAL, opting for a fast and scalable website built with Hugo instead of slower monolithic systems the competitors were using.
We had two goals:
Make it fast
We wanted to optimise the site as much as possible, so we opted for using Cloudinary, enabling us to take advantage of on-the-fly image manipulation, and thanks to the sheer speed of static sites, we achieved a perfect optimisation score with Google audits.</description>

      <description>After careful consideration of JavaScript/JSX-based static site generators, it became clear that Hugo was the only tool capable of handling our project&amp;rsquo;s complex demands. Not only do we have multiple content formats and taxonomies, but we often need to customize the experience at a more granular level. The problems Hugo has solved for us include:
 Render speed. We know from past experience that JavaScript-based static site generators become very slow when you have thousands of pages and images.</description>

      <description>At Over we&amp;rsquo;re into creativity, and technology should not get in the way. We want it to be easy for everyone to create, and Hugo does the same for us. That&amp;rsquo;s one of the reasons many of us are fond of using it.
People from all disciplines contribute to our website, be it legal documentation, layout and design, recruiting, marketing and of course… engineering. Hugo allows us to do this with as little friction as possible.</description>

      <description>Swiss Arolla campsite runs the highest campsite in Europe and I&amp;rsquo;m completely re-doing their actuel Website with Hugo.
But they just launch a brand new offer (luxury tents with bed and fire oven), and we couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait for the proper new website for having this promoted: we needed the website up and running within 24h!
So we decided to quickly launch a dedicated independent web site using all the powerful tools included with gohugo.</description>

      <description>Hugo is our static site generator (SSG) of choice. It&amp;rsquo;s really quick. After using it on a number of client projects, it became clear that our new site had to be built with Hugo.
The big benefit of an SSG is how it moves all the heavy lifting to the build time.
For example in WordPress, all the category pages are created at runtime, generating a lot of database queries. In Hugo, the paginated category pages are created at build time - so all the computational complexity is done once, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t impact the user at all.</description>

      <description>For Flesland Flis I use a combination of Hugo, Forestry.io and Netlify. Static Site Generators and Hugo has been on my radar for a long time, and with all the nice features released in Hugo the last years, it&amp;rsquo;s now my preferred solution for new clients. Also a huge thanks to the guys at Forestry.io, for making such a smooth CMS for Hugo.
The #1 reason why I love Hugo is the logic between content and layout, and of course the speed.</description>

      <description>It was clear from the get-go that we had to go with a static site generator. Static sites are secure, performant, and give you 100% flexibility. At Forestry.io we provide Content Management Solutions for websites built with static site generators, so we might be a little biased. The only question: Which static site generator was the right choice for us?
Why Hugo? In our early research we looked at Ionic’s site to get some inspiration.</description>

      <title>Let’s Encrypt</title>

      <guid>https://gohugo.io/showcase/letsencrypt/</guid>
      <description>The Let’s Encrypt website has a common set of elements: A landing page and some other static info-pages, a document section, a blog, and a documentation section. Having it moved to Hugo was mostly motivated by a simpler administration and Hugo&amp;rsquo;s multilingual support. They already serve HTTPS to more than 60 million domains, and having the documentation available in more languages will increase that reach.1
The Let&amp;#39;s Encrypt website is now built with @GoHugoIO, easing management and giving us access to more features.</description>

      <guid>https://gohugo.io/showcase/1password-support/</guid>
      <description>At 1Password, we used to go through a different documentation platform every month: blog engines, ebooks, wikis, site generators written in Ruby and JavaScript. Each was inadequate in its own special way. Then we found Hugo. We made one last switch, and we&amp;rsquo;re glad we did.
Not all static site generators are created equal Finding a tool that will make your customers, writers, designers, and DevOps team happy is no easy task, but we managed it with Hugo:</description>

      <description>After gradually handing over the control of our website to WordPress plugins, we realized that we needed to act.
Static web sites have natural advantages such as security, performance and content versioning (e.g. with Git). Static site generators such as Hugo made static websites cool again. Importantly, the best practices of software development (e.g. peer reviews, multi-stage deployments, rollbacks) can now be easily applied to websites.
Besides the blog and documentation sections, our website needed custom sections with own templates.</description>

      <guid>https://gohugo.io/showcase/quiply-employee-communications-app/</guid>
      <description>With the launch of our Employee Communications app Quiply we created a very simple and static one-page website to showcase our product.
As our customer base and demand for marketing and communication started to grow, we needed a solution to easily grow and extend the contents of our web presence. As we do not have the need to serve dynamic content, we decided to use a static site generator. Amongst a couple of others, we tried Hugo and it became immediately clear that we&amp;rsquo;d use Hugo going forward as it compiles super-fast, is intuitive to use and offers all the features we need.</description>

      <description>The documentation team at Linode has been writing guides since 2009, with the goal of helping new and experienced Linux users find the best tools and get the most out of their systems.
As our library grew into thousands of guides, we needed a fast static site generator with intuitive templating and the flexibility to extend Markdown without constantly writing HTML and CSS.
Hugo solved a lot of our growing pains with features like shortcodes, customizable URLs, LiveReload, and more.</description>

      <description>We’ve just launched a shiny new website for Hartwell Insurance – I’m really proud of it. It was tackled in a different way to most previous Tomango site builds, using some fancy new tools and some vintage web standards.
It’s a multi-page, single-page (!) website written in Hugo, a static site generator built with performance as a first-class feature. I’ve outlined a load of benefits to Hugo &amp;amp; static sites here, in case you’re interested.</description>

      <guid>https://gohugo.io/showcase/pace-revenue-management/</guid>
      <description>From the beginning, at Pace, we were focused on solving customer needs and didn&amp;rsquo;t want to over-engineer our marketing or sales. At the same time we didn&amp;rsquo;t want to lock ourselves into a Wordpress, Squarespace or the like.
The ideal was a fast, simple, static site builder. When we came across Hugo we were blown away. Being a European company we wanted to be multi-lingual from the get-go and allow multiple team-members to collaborate and own their content.</description>

      <description>Have a notable Hugo site1? We would love to feature it in this Showcase Section
We would really appreciate if you could:
 Fork https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs Run hugo new showcase/your-site (this requires &amp;gt;= Hugo 0.49). This will use the archetype bundle in the docs repo. Follow the instructions in the newly created page bundle. Create a new pull request in https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs/pulls    We want this to show Hugo in its best light, so this is not for the average Hugo blog.</description>
